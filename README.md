Unfortunately , I came to realse that that OpenCV in python cannot Use Pybag in order to Run on Github pages .
Here is my full journey on exploring it .
##### Good part is You can play this game via downloading the zip and running the main.py on your desktop after proper installation of the packages mentioned.
üì¶ Deployment Journey & Realization
Unfortunately, I came to realize that deploying a Python + OpenCV-based game with webcam access to the web has limitations. Here's a summary of what I tried and discovered:

‚úÖ I built a TicTacToe game using Pygame and OpenCV, allowing users to play using hand gestures via the webcam.

‚úÖ I successfully pushed the project to GitHub.

‚úÖ I used pygbag to convert the game into a web-friendly version (WebAssembly).

‚úÖ The build generated an index.html inside the build/web/ folder.

‚úÖ I deployed the game using GitHub Pages by moving the contents to a /docs folder and enabling GitHub Pages.

‚ö†Ô∏è The game loaded fine in the browser, but only showed a black screen after ‚ÄúReady to Start.‚Äù

‚ùå I later discovered that:

cv2.VideoCapture(0) does not work in browsers.

Python code running in browsers via WebAssembly is sandboxed, meaning it cannot access hardware devices like webcams.

The OpenCV webcam access requires native system permissions, which the browser doesn't allow for Python code.

‚úÖ I confirmed that the game works perfectly on:

Local desktop environments (Python installed)

Android (via .apk build)

‚úÖ I uploaded the .apk file and source code for others to download and run the full version with webcam support.
